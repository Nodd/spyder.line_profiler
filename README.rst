spyder_line_profiler
====================

Description
-----------

This is a plugin to run the python `line profiler <http://pythonhosted.org/line_profiler/>`_ from within the `spyder <https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/>`_ editor.

The code is an adaptation of the profiler plugin integrated in `spyder <https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/>`_.

Install instructions
--------------------

Put the files ``p_line_profiler.py`` and ``widgets/lineprofilergui.py`` in the directory ``spyderplugins/`` from the spyder installation.

For example on Linux this should be ``/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/spyderplugins/`` or equivalent.

The line_profiler module and the kernprof.py script have to be installed and acessible on the system. See the `official website <http://pythonhosted.org/line_profiler/>`_ for instructions.
